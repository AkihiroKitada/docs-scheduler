title: Upgrading to Scheduler for PCF v1.2
---
This topic explains how to upgrade Scheduler for PCF. It also explains
how Scheduler for PCF v1.2 automatically migrates data from a MySQL for PCF v1 database 
to a MySQL for PCF v2.3 or later database. This migration reduces dependency on MySQL for PCF v1.

##<a id="Prerequisites"></a>Prerequisites

Before you upgrade to Scheduler v1.2, you must have the following:

   + Scheduler for PCF v1.1
   + A MySQL for PCF v1.x or later tile with the data you want to migrate


##<a id="backup"></a>(Optional) Back up MySQL for PCF Database

Pivotal recommends backing up your MySQL for PCF database before installing Scheduler for PCF v1.2.
This is because upgrading your Scheduler for PCF installation from v1.1 to v1.2 triggers automatic migration of your data to a MySQL for PCF v2.3 or later database.

To back up your MySQL for PCF database, do one of the following:

+ If you are backing up a MySQL for PCF v1.x database, see [Perform Manual Backup](http://docs.pivotal.io/p-mysql/1-10/backup.html#manual-process).
+ If you are backing up a MySQL for PCF v2.3 or later database, see [Manual Backup](https://docs.pivotal.io/p-mysql/backup-and-restore.html#manual-backup).

## <a id="update-addons"></a>Update Add-Ons to Run with Xenial Stemcell

Scheduler for PCF v1.2.3 and later requires a Xenial stemcell.
If you are using any of the following BOSH add-ons with your PCF deployment,
you must update the add-on definition to include the Xenial stemcell before you deploy Scheduler for PCF v1.2.3:

+ File Integrity Monitoring for PCF Add-on.
  For update instructions,
  see [Updating FIM Add-on for PCF to Run with Xenial Stemcells](https://docs.pivotal.io/addon-fim/updating-for-xenial.html).
+ ClamAV for PCF Add-on.
  For update instructions,
  see [Updating ClamAV Add-on for PCF to Run with Xenial Stemcells](https://docs.pivotal.io/addon-antivirus/updating-for-xenial.html).
+ IPsec for PCF Add-on.
  For update instructions,
  see [Updating IPsec Add-on for PCF to Run with Xenial Stemcells](https://docs.pivotal.io/addon-ipsec/updating-for-xenial.html).

##<a id="upgrade_scheduler"></a>Upgrade to Scheduler for PCF v1.2

During upgrade, Scheduler for PCF automatically migrates your data from 
MySQL for PCF v1.x to MySQL for PCF v2.3 or later if you have the MySQL for PCF v2.3 or later tile installed.

To upgrade from Scheduler for PCF v1.1 to v1.2, do the following:

1. Download the Ubuntu Xenial stemcell from [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/stemcells-ubuntu-xenial),
and import it into the Ops Manager Stemcell Library. For instructions, see [Update Stemcell](./installing.html#stemcell).

1. Install MySQL for PCF v2.3 or later in the same PCF environment as 
your MySQL for PCF v1.x service instance. In the **Security** pane in the MySQL for PCF v2.3 or later tile, set **TLS Options** to **Optional** or **Not Configured**.
For information about installing MySQL for PCF v2.3 or later, see [Installing and Configuring MySQL for PCF](http://docs.pivotal.io/p-mysql/install-config.html).

1. Upgrade Scheduler for PCF to v1.2 with all errands enabled. For general information about upgrading
a tile, see [Upgrading PCF Products](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/upgrading-products.html#other-products).

	<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> All <strong>Post-Deploy Errands</strong> must be enabled 
    to migrate from a MySQL for PCF v1.x database to MySQL for PCF v2.3 or later database. 
	These settings are in the Scheduler for PCF <strong>Errands</strong> pane of 
    the Scheduler for PCF tile.</p> 

    During the upgrade, Scheduler for PCF detects your MySQL for PCF v1.x service binding.
    It then automatically migrates the MySQL for PCF v1.x database instance to a 
    MySQL for PCF v2.3 or later instance.
    The errand migrates the database and executes smoke tests.
    When the migration has completed successfully, the errand removes the service binding to the MySQL for PCF v1.x instance.

##<a id="migrate_later"></a>Migrate after Upgrading Scheduler for PCF 

If you upgrade Scheduler for PCF without the MySQL for PCF v2.3 or later tile installed, 
Scheduler for PCF v1.2 continues to use the MySQL for PCF v1.x database and service bindings. 

To migrate your data and service bindings to the MySQL for PCF v2.3 or later instance:

1. Download the Ubuntu Xenial stemcell from [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/stemcells-ubuntu-xenial),
and import it into the Ops Manager Stemcell Library. For instructions, see [Update Stemcell](./installing.html#stemcell).
1. Install the MySQL for PCF v2.3 or later tile. In the **Security** pane in the MySQL for PCF v2.3 or later tile, set **TLS Options** to **Optional** or **Not Configured**.
For information about installing MySQL for PCF v2.3 or later, see [Installing and Configuring MySQL for PCF](http://docs.pivotal.io/p-mysql/install-config.html).
1. Set all post-deploy errands to **On**.

1. In the Ops Manager Dashboard, do the following:

    1. If you are using Ops Manager v2.3 or later, click **Review Pending Changes**.
    For more information about this Ops Manager page, see
    [Reviewing Pending Product Changes](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/review-pending-changes.html).<br><br>
