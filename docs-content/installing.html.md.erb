This topic describes how to install and configure Scheduler for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF).

##<a id='prereqs'></a> Prerequisites

If you are installing Scheduler for PCF v1.2, Pivotal recommends having the MySQL for PCF v2.x tile installed. 

Before you install the Scheduler for PCF tile, you need to configure a MySQL for PCF service plan. The minimum resource configuration of the MySQL plan requires the following:

  * Service plan name: 1gb
  * Storage quota: 1,000 MB
  * Concurrent connections quota: 40

For more information, see [Add a Plan](https://docs.pivotal.io/p-mysql/index.html#service-plan) in the MySQL for PCF documentation.
