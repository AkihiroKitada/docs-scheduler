This topic contains release notes for the Scheduler for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) tile.

## v1.0.2

**Release Date:** April 21, 2017

### Features included in this release:

* Create Jobs.
* Run Jobs.
* Schedule Jobs.
* List Job History.

### Known issues in this release:

* Operators must create (if one doesn't already exist) a p-mysql service plan named `1gb` with at least 1000 MB of disk space.
* Only a `standard` service plan exists that allows scheduling of as many tasks as desired and at any scheduled interval desired.
* Some buildpacks (python and ruby) do not properly create a `web` process_type command by default.  These buildpacks require that you take special considerations or they will no longer be accessible via the CF CLI.
