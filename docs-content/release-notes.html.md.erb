This topic contains release notes for the Scheduler for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) tile.

## v1.0.2

**Release Date:** April 19, 2017

### Features included in this release:

* Create jobs.
* Run jobs.
* Schedule jobs.
* List job history.

### Known issues in this release:

* Operators must have a `p-mysql` service plan named `1gb` with at least 1,000 MB of disk space.
* Only a `standard` service plan exists that allows scheduling of as many tasks as needed and at any interval.
* Some buildpacks (Python and Ruby) do not create a `web` process_type when pushed with the `--no-start` option. Apps using these buildpacks require special consideration when used with Scheduler for PCF or those apps will no longer be accessible via the cf CLI after creating jobs for those apps.  You can avoid this side effect by creating a Procfile in the app, prior to pushing, that specifies a `web` process_type .
