This topic contains release notes for the Scheduler for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) tile.

## v1.0.2

**Release Date:** April 21, 2017

### Features included in this release:

* Create jobs.
* Run jobs.
* Schedule jobs.
* List job history.

### Known issues in this release:

* Operators must have a `p-mysql` service plan named `1gb` with at least 1,000 MB of disk space.
* Only a `standard` service plan exists that allows scheduling of as many tasks as needed and at any interval.
* Some buildpacks (Python and Ruby) do not properly create a `web` process_type command by default. These buildpacks require that you take special considerations or they will no longer be accessible via the cf CLI.
