title: Using Scheduler for PCF
owner: Partners
---

This topic provides instructions for using Scheduler for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF). The service enables ad hoc and scheduled execution of PCF tasks.

You can interact with the service through the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI) tool or the [Apps Manager](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/console/dev-console.html) UI.

For general information, see [Managing Service Instances with the cf CLI](http://docs.pivotal.io/devguide/services/managing-services.html). 

## <a id="prereqs"></a>Prerequisites

* A PCF installation with [Scheduler for PCF](https://network.pivotal.io/products/scheduler-for-pcf) installed and listed in the [Marketplace](http://docs.pivotal.io/devguide/services/#instances)
* A [Space Developer](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/concepts/roles.html#roles) account
* (Optional) If you want to use the Scheduler for PCF CLI Plugin, you must install it on your local machine. This plugin is packaged with the tile on Pivotal Network.

## <a id='process'></a>Create and Bind a Service Instance

Every app and service in PCF is scoped to a [space](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/concepts/roles.html#spaces), which means an app can only use a service if an instance of the service exists in the same space. 

The Scheduler for PCF service is a singleton service and only one service instance can be created in a space.

### <a id='marketplace'></a>Confirm Service Availability

To confirm your operator has installed Scheduler for PCF:

1. Run `cf marketplace` from the command line.
1. If the output lists `scheduler-for-pcf` in the `service` column, Scheduler for PCF is available. If it is not available, ask your operator to install it.

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf marketplace
    Getting services from marketplace in org my-org / space my-space as user<span>@</span>example.com...
    OK
    service             plans      description
    [...]
    scheduler-for-pcf   standard     Scheduler service
    [...]
    </pre>

### <a id='create'></a>Create a Service Instance

To create an instance of the Scheduler for PCF service, run `cf create-service scheduler-for-pcf standard SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME`, replacing `SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME` with a name of your choice. After you create the service instance, this name appears under `service` \[sic\] in the output from `cf services`.

See the following example:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf create-service scheduler-for-pcf standard my-instance<br>
Creating service my-instance in org my-org / space my-space as user<span>@</span>example.com...
OK<br>
$ cf services<br>
Getting services in org my-org / space my-space as user<span>@</span>example.com...
OK
name          service            plan    bound apps    last operation
my-instance   scheduler-for-pcf  standard              create succeeded
</pre>

You can only create one instance in a space.  If you attempt to create more than one instance in a space, you will get an error response.

### <a id="bind"></a>Bind a Service Instance to Your App

For an app to use a service, you must bind it to a service instance. Do this after you push or re-push the app using `cf push`.

To bind an app to a Scheduler instance, run `cf bind-service APP-NAME SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME`. Replace `APP-NAME` with the name of the app you want to use the Scheduler service for and `SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME` with the name you supplied when you ran `cf create-service`.

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf bind-service my-app my-instance<br>
Binding service my-instance to my-app in org my-org / space my-space as user<span>@</span>example.com...
OK
TIP: Use 'cf push' to ensure your env variable changes take effect
</pre>

## <a id="list-jobs"></a>Manage Jobs

See the following sections to learn about the operations you can perform with Scheduler for PCF.

### <a id="list-jobs"></a>Create a New Job

To execute tasks related to an app, create a new job by running `cf create-job APP-NAME JOB-NAME COMMAND`:

  * `APP-NAME` is the app you want to execute a task against.
  * `JOB-NAME` is the name for your newly created job. 
  * `COMMAND` is the command you wish to execute.
    
See the following example:

<pre class="terminal">
 $ cf create-job my-app my-job "pwd"<br>
 Creating job my-job for my-app with command pwd in org my-org / space my-space as user<span>@</span>example.com...
 Job Name   App Name        Command
 my-job     my-app          pwd
 OK
</pre>



### <a id="list-jobs"></a>List Jobs

Use the cf CLI to list all jobs in a space by running `cf jobs`. See the following example:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf jobs<br>
Listing jobs for org my-org / space my-space as user<span>@</span>example.com...
Job Name    App Name        Command
my-job      scheduler-api   pwd
OK
</pre>

### <a id="exec-jobs"></a>Execute a Job

You can execute a job manually. This is often useful to test the proper configuration of a job prior to scheduling it for recurring execution.

Run `cf run-job JOB-NAME`. See the following example:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf run-job my-job<br>
Enqueuing job my-job for app my-app in org my-org / space my-space as user<span>@</span>example.com...
OK
</pre>

### <a id="view-job-history"></a>View Job History

You can review job history by running `cf job-history JOB-NAME`:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf job-history my-job<br>
Getting scheduled job history for my-job in org my-org / space my-space as user<span>@</span>example.com...

### <a id="view-logs"></a>View Logs

You can view logs for jobs the same way you view logs for your app.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Scheduler jobs are executed as <a href="https://docs.run.pivotal.io/devguide/using-tasks.html">CF Tasks</a>.</p>

Enter `cf logs JOB-NAME --recent`. See the following example:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf logs my-job --recent<br>
Connected, dumping recent logs for app my-app in org my-org / space my-space as user<span>@</span>example.com...

### <a id="view-logs"></a>Schedule a job

You can schedule a job to execute at any time using a schedule expression. Scheduler for PCF requires cron expressions in the `MIN HOUR DAY-OF-MONTH MONTH DAY-OF-WEEK` format.

For example, to execute a job at noon every day, enter the following command:

<pre class="terminal">$ cf schedule-job my-job "0 12 * * * *"</pre>

A single job can have multiple schedules. Each schedule has a GUID to help distinguish it from similar schedules.

### <a id="view-schedules"></a>View Schedules for All Jobs in a Space

You can review schedules for all jobs in a space by running `cf job-schedules`. See the following example:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf job-schedules my-job "0 12 * * *"<br>
Getting scheduled jobs for org my-org / space my-space as user<span>@</span>example.com...
App Name: my-app
my-job        pwd    2b69e0c2-9664-46bb-4817-54afcedbb65d   0 12 * * *
OK
</pre>

### <a id="delete-job-schedule"></a>Delete a Job Schedule  

You can delete a specific schedule by running `cf delete-job-schedule SCHEDULE_GUID`, where `SCHEDULE_GUID` is the GUID found in the `job-schedules` command output. For example:  

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf delete-job-schedule 2b69e0c2-9664-46bb-4817-54afcedbb65d<br>
Really delete the schedule 2b69e0c2-9664-46bb-4817-54afcedbb65d / 0 12 * * * and all associated history?> [yN]: y
OK
</pre>	

### <a id="delete-job"></a>Delete a job

You can delete a job by running `cf delete-job JOB_NAME`. See the following example:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf delete-job my-job<br>
Really delete the job my-job with command pwd and all associated schedules and history?> [yN]:y
OK
</pre>
