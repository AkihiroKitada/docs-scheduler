This documentation describes Scheduler for PCF.

## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

Scheduler for PCF is a service for scheduling the execution of tasks on PCF, such as database migrations, emails, or batch jobs.

Scheduler for PCF enables developers to do the following:

* Create jobs to execute Diego tasks
* Execute jobs on an ad hoc basis
* Schedule jobs to execute on a recurring basis
* View job status and history

You can interact with the service through the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI), [Apps Manager](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-0/console/manage-apps.html), and the [Scheduler HTTP API](http://docs.pivotal.io/pcf-scheduler/1-0/api).

## <a id="reqs"></a> Requirements

+ MySQL for PCF v1.8 or v1.9. The service is available on [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/p-mysql/).

## <a id="limitations"></a> Limitations

* If your app uses a buildpack that does not generate a `web` process type, such as Ruby or Python, you should do the following:
<br><br>
    1. Before pushing your app, create a [Procfile](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/buildpacks/prod-server.html#procfile) in the root directory of the app.
    2. Declare a `web` process type in the file.

    If you do not declare this process type, your app will not be accessible through the cf CLI after you create Scheduler jobs for it.

* The maximum number of tasks that you can schedule is determined by the memory and disk quotas in the Scheduler for PCF org and space. See [Running Tasks](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/devguide/using-tasks.html#manage-tasks) for more information.
