+ MySQL for PCF v1.10. The service is available on [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/p-mysql/).

## <a id="limitations"></a>Limitations

* If your app uses a buildpack that does not generate a `web` process type, such as Ruby or Python, you should do the following:
<br><br>
    1. Before pushing your app, create a [Procfile](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/buildpacks/prod-server.html#procfile) in the root directory of the app.
    2. Declare a `web` process type in the file.

    If you do not declare this process type, your app will not be accessible through the cf CLI after you create Scheduler jobs for it.

* The maximum number of tasks that you can schedule is determined by the memory and disk quotas in the Scheduler for PCF org and space. See <a href="http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/devguide/using-tasks.html#manage-tasks">Running Tasks</a> for more information.
