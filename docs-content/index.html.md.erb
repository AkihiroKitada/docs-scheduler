This documentation describes Scheduler for PCF.

## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

Scheduler for PCF allows developers to schedule the execution of tasks on PCF, such as database migrations, emails, or batch jobs, without using external scheduling services.

Scheduler for PCF is a service broker that is exposed as a service in the Marketplace. Developers can interact with the service through the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI) and the [Scheduler HTTP API](http://docs.pivotal.io/pcf-scheduler/1-0/api).

Scheduler for PCF enables developers to do the following:

* Create jobs to execute Diego tasks
* Execute jobs on an ad hoc basis
* Schedule jobs to execute on a recurring basis
* View job status and history

## <a id="reqs"></a>Requirements

Scheduler for PCF has the following requirements:

+ MySQL for PCF v1.8 or v1.9, available on [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/p-mysql/)

## <a id="limitations"></a>Limitations

* If your app uses a buildpack that does not generate a `web` process type, such as Ruby or Python, you should do the following:
<br><br>
    1. Before pushing your app, create a [Procfile](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/buildpacks/prod-server.html#procfile) in the root directory of the app.
    2. Declare a `web` process type in the file.

    If you do not declare this process type, your app will not be accessible through the cf CLI after you create Scheduler jobs for it.

* The maximum amount of tasks you can schedule is determined by the memory and disk quotas in the org and space where you are using Scheduler for PCF. See <a href="http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/devguide/using-tasks.html#manage-tasks">Running Tasks</a> for more information.
