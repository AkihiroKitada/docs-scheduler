This documentation describes Scheduler for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF).

## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

Scheduler for PCF is a service for scheduling the execution of Diego tasks, 
such as database migrations, emails, or batch jobs, as well as the execution of outbound HTTP calls.

Scheduler for PCF enables developers to do the following:

* Create, run, and schedule jobs and view job history.
* Create, run, and schedule calls and view call history.

You can interact with the service through the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI), 
[Apps Manager](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/console/manage-apps.html#enable-scheduling), 
and the [Scheduler HTTP API](http://docs.pivotal.io/pcf-scheduler/1-1/api).

## <a id="reqs"></a>Requirements

Scheduler for PCF requires a MySQL database.

You can use any of the following:

+ The MySQL for PCF v1.10 tile. See [MySQL for PCF v1.10](http://docs.pivotal.io/p-mysql/1-10/).
+ The MySQL for PCF v2.x tile. See [MySQL for PCF](http://docs.pivotal.io/p-mysql).
+ An external MySQL database

## <a id="limitations"></a>Limitations

* If your app uses a buildpack that does not generate a `web` process type, 
such as Ruby or Python, you should do the following:
<br><br>
    1. Before pushing your app, create a 
    [Profile](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/buildpacks/prod-server.html#procfile) 
    in the root directory of the app.
    2. Declare a `web` process type in the file.

    If you do not declare this process type, your app will not be accessible through 
    the cf CLI after you create Scheduler jobs for it.

* The maximum number of tasks that you can schedule is determined by the memory 
and disk quotas in the Scheduler for PCF org and space. 
For more information, see [Running Tasks](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/devguide/using-tasks.html#manage-tasks).
